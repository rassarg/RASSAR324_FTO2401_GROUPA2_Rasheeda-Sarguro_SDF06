# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
Here I created a demo Instagram page using CSS, focusing on applying my knowledge of grids, flexbox, and how to target specific elements in an HTML file in order to format them in CSS. 

### Reflections
The hardest part of this was learning proportions and ratios. Just when I though I had figured out how to balance the page, if one numerical value was changed, it could throw the entire code out and render something odd. 
#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
Flexbox. The flexbox zombie game really drove home my understanding and application of flexbox, and now I even enjoy it.
- **Responsive Design**: 
- **Styling Elements**: 

#### Challenges Faced
-Numerical values. Anytime I had to target relative sizes I struggled to find the right proportions.
-The imgaes provided had different proportion sizes but all had the same class name. Targeting them individually wasn't possible if keeping the html code intact from what was provided, so finding an alternative way to proportion them was challenging.

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I struggle with this because I don't fully understand what dimensions I'm working with, so I don't know exactly how to create limitations on sizing for different windows
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I couldn't quite get this to work because I couldn't understand why it didnt respond the same way as a grid or flexbox layout.

#### Areas for Improvement
-Hover and focus effects.
-responsive deisgn.


- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: how to write a layout in simpler code
- **Creative Design Choices**: I wanted to keep it as close to an instagram layout as possible. In doing that I also wanted to add a border circle around the user avatar, but I couldn't figure out how to make that work, so I simply changed the background instead.

#### Overall Learning Experience
I found the learning experience great but this project itself I found stressful and overwhelming.
Whilst learning the course, I thought I understood what to do. But then when I had so many different elements and areas to focus on suddenly, it became very distracting and hard to focus on what needed to be done. I definitely enjoyed using flexbox more than grid because it relied less on numerical values. I do wish there were less areas to focus on in this project as it made targeting problems more overwhelming. I know I need to spend more time with understanding how layouts are affected in CSS, as well as how to write functioning code.
