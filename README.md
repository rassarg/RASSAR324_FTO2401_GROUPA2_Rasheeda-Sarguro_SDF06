# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
Here I created a demo Instagram user profile page using CSS, focusing on applying my knowledge of grids, flexbox, and how to target specific elements in an HTML file in order to style them in CSS. 

### Reflections
The hardest part of this was learning proportions and ratios and how they all react to one another. Just when I thought I had figured out how to balance the layout on a page, if one numerical value was changed, it could throw the entire code out and render something odd. 

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
Flexbox. The flexbox zombie game really drove home my understanding and application of flexbox, and now I enjoy it.
- **Responsive Design**: 
I believe that I need to work on this area more. I have sort of implemented it on my page, but I can tell that it hasn't worked as well as I would like it to  
- **Styling Elements**: 
I was able to personalize the style for the profile image, the buttons available, as well as the loader page at the bottom of the page.

#### Challenges Faced
-Numerical values. Anytime I had to target relative sizes I struggled to find the right proportions.
-The images provided had different proportion sizes but all had the same class name. Targeting them individually wasn't possible if keeping the html code intact from what was provided, so finding an alternative way to proportion them was challenging.

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I initially struggled with this because I had thought that we had to approached it from the perspective of "what size is the box do we want it to display on", not fully understanding how exactly the media query reacts. 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: It took some reasearch but I managed to get most of the elements of this to work properly.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I would like to focus more on exactly how different layout properties interact and affect each other, as well as how they impact the page itself.
- **Code Optimization**: I would like to improve on how I can write a simpler code
- **Creative Design Choices**: I wanted to keep it as close to an instagram layout as possible.
In doing so I wanted to add a color border circle around the user avatar to match that of an Instagram story. That proved to be a little trickier than I had hoped. Instead, I styled the background of the user avatar to have the same colors as an Instagram story.
Additionally, because the images provided have different proportion sizes, I wanted to ensure that the whole image was kept in without cropping it, while at the same time keeping the layout of the grid looking cohesive. To achive this, I added a slight background color. Doing this sort of tricks the eye into believing they are all the same size

#### Overall Learning Experience
I found the learning experience of the course great. I was glad to test out my knowledge in an environment that was probably closer to the real world.
I will admit that this project itself tested me.
Whilst learning the course, I thought I understood what to do, but when I had to implement it, as well as add in so many other different elements and areas to focus on suddenly, it became very distracting and hard to focus on what needed to be done.
I know I need to spend more time with understanding how layouts are affected in CSS, as well as how to write neater, better-functioning code.
