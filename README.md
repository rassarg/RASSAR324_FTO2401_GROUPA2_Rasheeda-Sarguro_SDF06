# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
Here I created a demo Instagram page using CSS, focusing on applying my knowledge of grids, flexbox, and how to target specific elements in an HTML file in order to format them in CSS. 

### Reflections
The hardest part of this was learning proportions and ratios. Just when I though I had figured out how to balance the page, if one numerical value was changed, it could throw the entire code out and render something odd. 
#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
Flexbox. The flexbox zombie game really drove home my understanding and application of flexbox, and now I even enjoy it.
- **Responsive Design**: 
- **Styling Elements**: 

#### Challenges Faced
number values. Anytime I had to target relative lengths I struggled to find the right proportions.
Additionally, targeting the child of a specific class took me some time to figure out as I hadn't quite grasped how to target a child when a class name is repeated in the html.

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: 
- **Creative Design Choices**:

#### Overall Learning Experience
