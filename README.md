# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
Here I created a demo Instagram page using CSS, focusing on applying my knowledge of grids, flexbox, and how to target specific elements in an HTML file in order to format them in CSS. 

### Reflections
The hardest part of this was learning proportions and ratios. Just when I though I had figured out how to balance the page, if one numerical value was changed, it could throw the entire code out and render something odd. 
#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
Flexbox. The flexbox zombie game really drove home my understanding and application of flexbox, and now I even enjoy it.
- **Responsive Design**: 
- **Styling Elements**: 

#### Challenges Faced
-Numerical values. Anytime I had to target relative sizes I struggled to find the right proportions.
-The imgaes provided had different proportion sizes but all had the same class name. Targeting them individually wasn't possible if keeping the html code intact from what was provided, so finding an alternative way to proportion them was challenging

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: 
- **Code Optimization**: 
- **Creative Design Choices**:

#### Overall Learning Experience
I definitely enjoyed using flexbox more than grid because it relied less on numerical values.
